I am a researcher at the [Hamburg Institute of International Economics (HWWI)](https://www.hwwi.org/home.html) and PhD student  at the [University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/614394.html) and 

In my dissertation, I investigate the long-run dynamics of globalization on economic development. My research interests are in international and development economics, including political economy, international trade and migration. I am an empirical economist, relying on granular data and historic sources. For my work, I often undertake extensive data collection efforts, for which I make use of GIS and machine learning methods.

<!-- My work is mostly empirical, relying on granular data and historic sources and combining methods from causal inference with GIS and machine learning. -->
I am also a research affiliate at the [Kiel Institute for the World Economy](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/institute/research-centers/international-development/) and [SoDa Labs at Monash University, Melbourne](https://www.monash.edu/business/research/our-research/impact-labs/soda-labs).
